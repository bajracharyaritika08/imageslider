 The code is used to find the number of slides in a slider.
 const slidesLength = slideRight.querySelectorAll('div').length //we take this negative because the left silde is going to go up.
 slideLeft.style.top = `-${(slidesLength - 1) * 100}vh`
 The code will change the slides in a slider to go up or down depending on the direction of the click.
